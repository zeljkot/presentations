# Imperative vs  Declarative

* Imperative: HOW
* Declarative: WHAT

Note:

Wikipedia:
* A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.
* Any programming language that lacks side effects (or more specifically, is referentially transparent)
* A language with a clear correspondence to mathematical logic.

Functional and logical programming languages
